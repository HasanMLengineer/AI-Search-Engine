## 🚀 **Overview**

The **AI Search Engine** revolutionizes traditional search methodologies by integrating **vector embeddings** and **vector search** techniques. This project leverages state-of-the-art NLP models and machine learning workflows to provide highly accurate and semantically relevant search results, offering an unparalleled user experience.

---

## 🔧 **Features**

- **Semantic Search**: Understands the meaning behind user queries using vector embeddings.
- **Efficient Vector Search**: Implements advanced similarity measures like cosine similarity for fast and accurate results.
- **Model Integration**: Supports pre-trained NLP models like **Llama 3.1 GGUF**, **BERT**, and **Sentence-BERT**.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Combines MongoDB for data storage with FAISS or Pinecone for vector management.

## 📚 **Workflow**

1. **Data Ingestion**:
    - Product descriptions, metadata, and user queries are prepared and cleaned.
    - Data is stored in **MongoDB** for fast retrieval.

2. **Text Embeddings**:
    - Text data is converted into dense **vector embeddings** using pre-trained NLP models.
    - Models include:
      - Llama 3.1 GGUF
      - Sentence-BERT
      - OpenAI Embeddings

3. **Query Processing**:
    - User queries are embedded into vectors.
    - These vectors represent the semantic meaning of the query.

4. **Vector Search**:
    - Embeddings are compared using **cosine similarity** to find the most relevant products.
    - Top-matching results are retrieved and ranked.

5. **Result Display**:
    - The top results are displayed to users in a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

## 🔍 **Vector Search with Vector Embeddings**

The core innovation in this search engine is its use of **vector embeddings** and **vector search**.

### **What are Vector Embeddings?**
- A numerical representation of text, capturing semantic relationships.
- Similar phrases or queries have embeddings close to each other in high-dimensional space.

### **How Vector Search Works**

1. **Query Embedding**:
   - User queries are transformed into vectors using NLP models.

2. **Product Embedding**:
   - Product descriptions are pre-processed into vector embeddings.

3. **Similarity Search**:
   - Using measures like **cosine similarity**, the search engine identifies products closest to the query in the vector space.

4. **Result Ranking**:
   - Products are ranked based on similarity scores.

### **Example**:

#### Query: "Best laptop for gaming"
- **Query Vector**: `[0.27, 0.35, -0.1, 0.87, ...]`
- **Product Vector**:
  - Gaming Laptop 1: `[0.25, 0.3, -0.1, 0.9, ...]` (High similarity)
  - Basic Laptop: `[0.2, 0.1, -0.05, 0.85, ...]` (Low similarity)

#### Output: The gaming laptop ranks higher due to semantic relevance.
